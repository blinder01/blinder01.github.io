**What i did**

I almost exclusively referenced the w3schools.com website to learn all the wonderful bits and pieces of css files. [Here is the link to that site](https://www.w3schools.com/)


To start, I did a basic layout of the header and body text as a placeholder and 1st version.

Then I put in an audio file to make sure it was working and in the correct place.

All of the css file stuff was a bit nasty at the beginning, I didn't use a css file at first at all. I put it all in a style section. Moving everything to css was a lot easier. During our meeting, you suggested this. It helped a lot! You also helped with some organization in general. After I left our meeting, I reformatted some stuff, and it worked more reliably more often.

The video files were also pretty straightforward. I referenced the w3schools' javascript function for my slideshow. The one I referenced actually auto-changed the photos, which I did not want. To do this, I removed some for loops from the code that increased by 1. The function was very buggy at first, and did not swap between pictures. It was an issue with naming files, so I assigned each photo with a number, that started at 1, and increased by 1 when you hit the dots below it.

The only other real issues I ran into were scaling the files and keeping them centered. I used auto padding for both sides to keep the slideshow, text, video, and audio files to be centered on the page. I tried to find a way for the file to translate in a smaller window, but couldn't get the text to wrap correctly.
